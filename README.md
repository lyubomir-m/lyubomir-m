I am looking for a fully remote Senior, Staff, Principal, or similar Backend role at companies that can employ me in Bulgaria via their Bulgarian entity, an employer of record in Bulgaria, or are willing to get an employer of record in Bulgaria, because this is strictly required by local banks for home mortgage loans to individuals. My target annual base salary is €100,000–€120,000 gross (cash-only; no equity/bonus expected).

I am based in **Sofia, Bulgaria** (**EET/EEST – UTC+2 / UTC+3**).  
Below are my typical working windows and how they map to common European time zones  
(assuming a local office day of **08:00–17:00** in each region).
